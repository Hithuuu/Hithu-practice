# Hithu-practice
try to make a Chrome plugin that help doing reading for ADHDers (or myself). 
it's simply a color frame to help u focus on the paragraph ur reading.

## things still need to be improved:
- can't delet, once opened
- need color and opacity to be adjusted
- not so good react of keyboard controll when reading
