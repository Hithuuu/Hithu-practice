# Hithu-practice
try to make a Chrome plugin that help doing reading for ADHDers (or myself). 
it's simply a color frame to help u focus on the paragraph ur reading.

## things still need to be improved:
1.can't delet, once opened
2.need color and opacity to be adjusted
3.not so good react of keyboard controll when reading
